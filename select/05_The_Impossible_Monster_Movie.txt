When the fist star starts to shine
Over my horizon in my mind
I hold my hands out to catch it
But I can't catch it. No... No... No...
So I dreamt to be impossible only reaching higher
And it helped me make it through the night
But I see everything simpler
As a walk on the higher wire
And I will never believe that it will be alright... alright...

I've always wanted to believe
In the things that I can't see
I reach my hands out to hold them
But I can't hold them. No... No... No...
So I dreamt to be impossible with me, reaching higher
And it helped me make it through the night
But I see everything simpler
As a walk on the higher wire
And I will never believe that it will be alright... alright...

Both can't think of nails on the gilt face
Still I don? t know
When will reach the valley below
And where am I going? Am I free fall?
If it lasts forever it will feel like nothing at all, nothing at all
So I dreamt to be impossible with me, reaching higher
And it helped me make it through the night
But I see everything simpler
As a walk on the higher wire
And I will never believe that it will be alright... alright...
