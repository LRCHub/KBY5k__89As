Giving my life the "highs" and "lows"
Love - I'm trying to hold
Weaker I get everyday
Lose control of the things that I say
Tell me how can I get right
Like a day without his bite
Don't know which way to go
Don't
Know what I'm looking for
Meditate all th time
Hoping that I can find
A ladder that I can climb
To get this off my mind
Until then I'll just be trapped
In her arms I'm deeply wrapped
Until I lose control and start
To scream and scold

Show me a land where
Someone like me
Can make a stand
Make any living when
All that you can
Is tear down all you don't understand
I find you're a little impossible
I find you're a little impossible
Impossible to me

Time is breathless - you better check
This way we're livin' is wreckless
Jealousy kill the people with envy
Lack of self control that could be
The answer that you're throwing on
To a life style that ya showin' on
So go on with your bad self until
Find ya life in a shelf
Checking your beeper
Trying to keep her
Most of the time can't even sleep
Living large - she's in charge
Mercedes Benz and Credit Cards
Rolling big bucks your holding
Rings you wear are often stoln
Show down - take a lock at yourself
Be thankful for your health

Show me a land where ...
